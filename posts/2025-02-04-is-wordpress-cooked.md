# Is WordPress Cooked?

This is my first Claude Code experiment. It's a vibe-coded personal landing page and blog, all based off of a cyberpunk-style image that I generated using Nanobanana.

Admittedly, the page is relatively simple, but I was able to create it all by talking at my computer. It took me the better part of an afternoon, but some of that was configuring my GitHub account, getting SSH keys added, and familiarizing myself with some of the old web tools I haven't touched in a while.

## The Process

The entire site was built through conversation. I described what I wanted, and Claude Code wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When something didn't look right, I just said so, and it got fixed. No manual coding required.

Some highlights of what we built together:

- A cyberpunk-themed landing page with animated gradient text
- A TV-style glitch animation that alternates between "MYBBOR" and "ROBBYM"
- Social media links with Font Awesome icons
- A QR code generator so I can show people this site from my phone
- A markdown-based blog system (you're reading it now)
- Rain and scanline effects for that retro CRT aesthetic

## What This Means for WordPress

As someone who co-founded a WordPress page builder, I've been thinking a lot about what AI-assisted development means for the future of the platform.

When you can describe a website and have it built in an afternoon through conversation, what happens to the traditional CMS? What happens to page builders? What happens to themes and plugins?

I don't have all the answers yet, but I'm definitely paying attention.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. I'm planning to keep experimenting with Claude Code and documenting what I learn along the way. If you're interested in AI-assisted development, stay tuned.

And if you're wondering whether WordPress is cooked... well, that's a conversation worth having.
